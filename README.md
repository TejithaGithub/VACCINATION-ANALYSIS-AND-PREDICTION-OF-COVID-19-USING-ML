# VACCINATION-ANALYSIS-AND-PREDICTION-OF-COVID-19-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

This project creates an interactive framework to analyze global COVID-19 vaccination progress, utilizing data visualization tools and machine learning algorithms. It provides powerful analytics and predicts future COVID-19 cases, aiding governments and healthcare professionals in making informed response plans.

Analysis Module:
Visualizations are drawn to answer the following questions on the different aspects of vaccination.
- 1. Which country is using what vaccine or What vaccines are used and in which countries?
- 2. What is the vaccine distribution? Are there any decreases in the number of cases in the countries that begin the vaccination process?
- 3. In which country the vaccination programme is more advanced?
- 4. After the beginning of the vaccine process all around the world, how the infection trend moves?

Prediction Module
- It includes prediction of future COVID-19 cases using machine learning algorithms such as
  Support Vector Regression
  Polynomial Regression
  Bayesian Ridge Regression
